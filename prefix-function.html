          <h1 data-toc-text="ignore">Prefix function. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</h1>

          <h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
          <p>
            You are given a string \( S \) of length \( N \). The
            <b>prefix function</b> for this string is defined as
            an array \( \pi \) of length \( N \), such that \( \pi[i] \) is the length
            of the longest proper prefix of the substring \( S[0 \ldots i] \) which is
            also a suffix of this substring. A proper prefix of a string is a
            prefix that is not equal to the string itself. By definition \( \pi[i] = 0 \).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mathematically the definition of the prefix function can be written as follows:
            \[ \pi[i] = \max_ {k = 0 \dots i} \{k : S[0 \dots k-1] = S[i-(k-1) \dots i] \} \]
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the prefix function of string \( abcabcd \) is \( [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0] \),
            and the prefix function of string \( aabaaab \) is \( [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3] \).
          </p>

          <h3 id="trivial-algorithm">Trivial algorithm</h3>
          <p>An algorithm which follows the definition of prefix function exactly is the following:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums" style="font-size: 16px;">
vector&ltint&gt prefix_function(string s) {
  int n = s.length();
  vector&ltint&gt pi(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    for (int k = 0; k <= i; ++k)
      if (s.substr(0, k) == s.substr(i - k + 1, k))
        pi[i] = k;
  return pi;
}</pre>
          <p>It is easy to see that its complexity is \( O(N^3) \), which has room for improvement.</p>

          <h3 id="efficient-algorithm">Efficient algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            This algorithm was proposed by Knuth and Pratt and independently from them by Morris in 1977.
            It was used as the main function of a substring search algorithm.
          </p>

          <h4 id="first-optimization" data-toc-text="ignore">First optimization</h4>
          <p>
            The first important observation is, that the values of the prefix function can only increase by at most one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, otherwise, if \( \pi[i + 1] > \pi[i] + 1 \), then we can take
            this suffix ending in position \( i + 1 \) with the length \( \pi[i + 1] \)
            and remove the last character from it. We end up with a suffix ending in
            position \( i \) with the length \( \pi[i + 1] - 1\), which is better
            than \( \pi[i] \), i.e. we get a contradiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following illustration shows this contradiction. The longest proper suffix at position \( i \) that also is a prefix is of length \( 2 \)
            and at position \( i + 1 \) it is of length \( 4 \). Therefore the string \( s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3 \) is equal to the string
            \( s_{i-2} ~ s_{i-1} ~ s_i ~ s_{i+1} \), which means that also the strings \( s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 \) and \( s_{i-2} ~ s_{i-1} ~ s_i \) are
            equal, therefore \( \pi[i + 1] \) has to be \( 3 \).

            \[ \underbrace{\overbrace{S_0 ~ S_1}^{\pi[i] = 2} ~
            S_2 ~ S_3}_{\pi[i+1] = 4} ~ \dots ~ \underbrace{S_{i-2} ~
            \overbrace{S_{i-1} ~ S_{i}}^{\pi[i] = 2} ~ S_{i+1}}_{\pi[i+1] = 4} \]

            Thus when moving to the next position, the value of the prefix function can either increase by one, stay the same, or decrease by some amount.
            This fact already allows us to reduce the complexity of the algorithm to \( O(N^2) \), because in one step the
            prefix function can grow at most by one. In total the function can grow at most \( N \) steps, and therefore can also only decrease a total of
            \( N \) steps. This means we only have to perform \( O(N) \) string comparisons, and reach the complexity \( O(N^2) \).
          </p>

          <h4 id="second-optimization" data-toc-text="ignore">Second optimization</h4>
          <p>
            Let's go further, we want to get rid of the string comparisons.
            To accomplish this, we have to use all the information computed
            in the previous steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let us compute the value of the prefix function \( \pi \)
            for \( i + 1 \). If \( s[i + 1] = s[\pi[i]] \), then we can
            say with certainty that \( \pi[i + 1] = \pi[i] + 1 \),
            since we already know that the suffix at position \( i \)
            of length \( \pi[i] \) is equal to the prefix of length
            \( \pi[i] \). This is illustrated again with an example.

            \[ \underbrace{\overbrace{S_0 ~ S_1 ~ S_2}^{\pi[i]} ~
            \overbrace{S_3}^{S_3 = S_{i+1}}}_{\pi[i+1] = \pi[i] + 1} ~
            \dots ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{S_{i-2} ~ S_{i-1} ~ S_{i}}^{\pi[i]} ~
            \overbrace{S_{i+1}}^{S_3 = S_i + 1}}_{\pi[i+1] = \pi[i] + 1} \]

            If this is not the case, \( S[i + 1] \neq S[\pi[i]] \), then we need to try
            a shorter string. In order to speed things up, we would like to immediately
            move to the longest length \( j < \pi[i] \), such that the prefix property
            in the position \( i \) holds, i.e.
            \( S[0 \ldots j - 1] = S[i - j + 1 \ldots i]: \)
            \[ \overbrace{\underbrace{S_0 ~ S_1}_j ~ S_2 ~ S_3}^{\pi[i]} ~ \dots ~ \overbrace{S_{i-3} ~ S_{i-2} ~ \underbrace{S_{i-1} ~ S_{i}}_j}^{\pi[i]} ~ S_{i+1} \]

            Indeed, if we find such a length \(j\), then we again only need to compare
            the characters \( S[i + 1] \) and \( S[j] \). If they are equal, then we can
            assign \( \pi[i + 1] = j + 1 \). Otherwise we will need to find the largest value
            smaller than \( j \), for which the prefix property holds, and so on. It can happen
            that this goes until \( j = 0 \). If then \( S[i + 1] = S[0] \), we assign
            \( \pi[i + 1] = 1\), and \( \pi[i + 1] = 0 \) otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we already have a general scheme of the algorithm. The only question left is how do
            we effectively find the lengths for \( j \). Let's recap: for the current length \( j \)
            at the position \( i \) for which the prefix property holds, i.e.
            \( S[0 \ldots j - 1] = S[i - j + 1 \ldots i] \), we want to find the greatest
            \( k < j \), for which the prefix property holds.

            \[ \overbrace{\underbrace{S_0 ~ S_1}_k ~ S_2 ~ S_3}^j ~ \dots ~ \overbrace{S_{i-3} ~ S_{i-2} ~ \underbrace{S_{i-1} ~ S_{i}}_k}^j ~S_{i+1} \]

            The illustration shows, that this has to be the value of \( \pi[j - 1] \), which we
            already calculated earlier.
          </p>

          <h4 id="final-algorithm" data-toc-text="ignore">Final algorithm</h4>
          <p>
            So we finally can build an algorithm that doesn't perform any string comparisons and
            only performs \( O(N) \) actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the final procedure:
            <ul>
              <li>
                We compute the prefix values \( \pi[i] \) in a loop by iterating from \( i = 1 \) to
                \( i = n - 1 \) ( \( \pi[0] \) just gets assigned with 0).
              </li>
              <li>
                To calculate the current value \( \pi[i] \) we set the variable \( k \) denoting
                the length of the best suffix for \( i - 1 \). Initially \( k = \pi[i - 1] \).
              </li>
              <li>
                Test if the suffix of length \( j + 1 \) is also a prefix by comparing \( S[j] \) and
                \( S[i] \). If they are equal then we assign \( \pi[i] = k + 1 \), otherwise we reduce
                \( k \) to \( \pi[k - 1] \) and repeat this step.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we have reached the length \( j = 0 \) and still don't have a match, then we assign
                \( \pi[i] = 0 \) and go to the next index \( i + 1 \).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4 data-toc-text="ignore">Task</h3>
          <p>
            Given a text \( T \) and a string \( S \) we want to find and display the positions
            of all occurrences of the string \( S \) in the text \( T \).
          </p>

          <h4 data-toc-text="ignore">Approach</h3>
          <p>
            For convenience we denote with \( N \) the length of the string \( S \) and
            with \( M \) the length of the text \( T \).
          </p>
          <p>
            We will consider the string \( S + \# + T \) where \( \# \) is a separator that
            appears neither in \( S \) nor in \( T \). Let us look at the values of
            \( \pi \), the prefix function for this new string.
            By definition, \( \pi[i] \) is the longest length
            of a substring ending at position \( i \) that is also a prefix. Due to the separator,
            the value of \( \pi[i] \) cannot exceed \( N \). However, if for some \( i \),
            \( \pi[i] = N \), then it means that the string \( S \) is a substring ending at
            position \( i \). Thus, we found a match!.
